# discord_big_beng

this bot will actually let you **HEAR** the hours you pass on discord with your friends, so you don't actually forget to sleep (yes it happened).

## installing dependencies

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## setting up environment variables

1 - use your favourite text editor to input these values in a file called `.env`

`nano .env`

2 - insert these values

```
TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
SOUND_PATH=./dong.mp3
CHANNEL_ID=CHANNEL_ID_THE_BOT_WILL_JOIN_IN
```

you could also change the mp3 file to play a different sound than the default **dong**.

this bot will join every hour to play the chosen sound.

HAVE FUN :DDD <33
